I am a software engineer, working closely with embedded systems. I have worked in all the aspects of embedded software development from low level bootloaders and firmware, to higher level application software for distributed devices and everything in between. I have worked with embedded Linux and also with bare-metal as well as with a a Real Time Operating System (RTOS - vxWorks) on a few different teams for a couple of different successful products, from WiFi to Avionics, with the most successful being [Cisco Catalyst
9115-AX](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/collateral/wireless/catalyst-9100ax-access-points/datasheet-c78-741988.html), [Comcast Xfinity X6](https://corporate.comcast.com/press/releases/comcast-launches-internet-device-multi-gigabit-speeds-wifi-6) and [General Atomics MQ-9B SkyGuardian Unmanned Aerial Vehicle(UAV)](https://www.ga-asi.com/remotely-piloted-aircraft/mq-9b).

## Interests
Besides making cool stuff with computers, I like to both cook and eat food. I am especially proud of my Mediterranean style Tuna recipe. I am also an avid runner. I enjoy running, though not the competitive type of running. When I'm not injured, I usually like to run on hiking trails.
