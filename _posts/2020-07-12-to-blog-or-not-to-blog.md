For quite some time now, I have been internally debating on whether or not to start a blog. On the one hand, I see it as an opportunity to write about things that interest me, and to share those things with the world. On the other hand, I fear that my time and effort spent preparing and writing this blog will go unnoticed—to waste—because nobody will find my blog or read my posts, and that learning a new skill would be a better use of my time. However, the more I think about it, the more I
realize that this debate is more about writing (or not writing) than blogging (or not blogging).

Writing—clear,direct,humane—and communicating effectively are two very important skills, especially for software engineers like myself. We are always writing things, whether it be comments in PR code review, design documents for new features, or comments in the code files. In addition to helping communicate effectively, writing helps strength one's critical thinking and one's ability to articulate things. Not to mention the plethora of other benefits of writing. And with this, I rest my case
and conclude that I will start blogging, and I encourage others to do the same. Let the journey begin!
